# Video Game Machine Learning

In this project, I will explore the vgsales dataset containing sales information on over 16000 games.  The dataset features columns that detail game publisher, sales rank, platform, year released, and regional sales information.  After exploring and cleaning the data, I will apply some machine learning techniques to predict global sales.
